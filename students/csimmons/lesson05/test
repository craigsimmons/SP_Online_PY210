new_list = []
for variable in a_list:
    if something_is_true:
        new_list.append(expression)

This kind of “filtering” loop can be achieved by adding a conditional to the comprehension:
new_list = [expr for var in a_list if something_is_true]
This is expressing the “filter” pattern and the “map” pattern at the same time – one reason I like the comprehension syntax so much.
